      Activity Instructions

      1. Prompt for Name:

      - Use prompt() to ask the user for their name and store the response in a variable userName.
      - If the user provides a name, display a welcome message using alert() that includes their name.
      - If the user does not provide a name or clicks "Cancel", display an error message in the console saying: "You did not provide your name. Bye Bye!" 

      2. Confirm to Continue:
      - After displaying the welcome message, ask the user if they want to continue using confirm().
      - If the user selects "OK", show an alert confirming their choice to continue.
      - If the user selects "Cancel", show an alert indicating the action was canceled.

      3. Log Screen Details:
      - Log the browser's inner width and height (innerWidth and innerHeight) to the console.
  
      4. Reload the Page:
      - Inform the user via console.log() that the page will reload in 10 seconds.
      - Use setTimeout() to reload the page after 10 seconds using window.location.reload().

      // Solution
      // Ask username
      const userName = prompt("What is your name?");

      // Check if user provided name or not
      if (userName && userName.length > 0) {
        // Confirm if user wants to continue
        const IsContinue = confirm("Do you still want to continue?");

        if (IsContinue) {
          alert("You chose to continue. Yay");

          // Print screen details
          console.log(
            `Your inner screen sizes are height: ${innerHeight} and width: ${innerWidth}`
          );

          // Let user know about page reload
          let TIMER = 10000;
          console.log(`Page is about to reload in ${TIMER} seconds`);

          // Reload
          setTimeout(() => {
            window.location.reload();
          }, TIMER)

        } else {
          alert("You chose not to continue! Sorry to see you go!");
        }

      } else {
        console.log("Sorry name not provided! Bye Bye!");
      }
