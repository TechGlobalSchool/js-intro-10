constructor: is a special kind of method used to create objects from prototypes or classes 
-An ES6 class can have only ONE constructor 
-If we do not create a custom constructor, JS will provide us the default constructor 


class Animal {
  constructor() {} // default constructor

  makesNoise() {
    console.log('Makes noise');
  }
}

const a1 = new Animal();
a1.makesNoise();


EXAMPLE
class Date{
  
}


const date = new Date();

Class members: properties, constructors, functions

INHERITANCE: it is a common concept used in all the programming languages
It increases code reusability by child classes from parent classes 
Public properties, functions and constructors of the parent classes can be inherited by child classes
Private properties and functions in parent classes cannot be inherited 
Parent cannot inherit from child 
One child class can have ONLY parent 
One parent class can have multiple child classes 



class A extends B {

}

class C extend A {

}

A is the child class 
B is the parent class
