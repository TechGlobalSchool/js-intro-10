JS Prototypes or Classes are used to improve the reusability of the objects

Prototype or class = template from which you can create many objects 
Objects or instances are created from prototypes or classes using constructor together 
with new keyword


Inheritance: it is building a parent-child relationship between 2 classes or prototypes. 
In this case, child class or prototype will be able to use all (not private) parent members (functions
properties, constructor).

How do we achieve Inheritance? 
we use extends keyword 

What is method overriding?
When child class inheriting parent class but changes the method body.

What is method overloading?
When you are able to use the same method with different arguments

Math.max(2, 3);
Math.max('2', '3');
Math.max(2, 3, 4);

Method overriding vs method overloading?
overriding happens in the case of inheritance and when child class re-implements a new body for a parent class method
overloading is just using same method name with different arguments

Syntax:

class Person {
  eat() {

  }

  sleep() {

  }
}

class Programmer extends Person {
  // method overriding
  eat() {
    // different body
  }

  code() {

  }
}

-one parent can have multiple child that extends from it 
-one child can extend to ONE parent only.


What is super()?
super() is used to inherit parent constructor into child constructor
