Template Literals - Backticks `` 
let-const keys for variables 
arrow functions
includes(), startsWith(), endsWith() string methods
for...of loop
Spread operator


let vs const 

similarities
  - ES6 features 
  - they are used to declare variables
  - they can't be hoisted. var is hoisted (declaration moved to the top)
  - they both respect function and block scope. var does not respect block scope.

differences
  - let allows variables to be reassigned but const does not.
  - const usually used with reference types while let is used with primitives (not all the time)
  - let can be declared without initialization but const MUST be initialized. 
  - const is used for constants that you will never reassign after their initialization.


const variableName; // Error
const variableName = 5; // MUST be initialized 

let variableName; // undefined



***INTERVIEW QUESTION***
Compiler time errors: these are the errors you see before running the program.
Runtime errors: these are the errors you see after running the program.


ITERABLE OBJECTS: objects, arrays, maps, sets 


***INTERVIEW QUESTION***
spread operator: spreads the array elements or object properties into their individual elements or properties 
rest parameters: is going to collect given arguments in an array



OOP - Object Oriented Programming 

OOP Languages: C#, C++, Java 

JavaScript is proto-type based programming language.
ES6 also implemented OOP with classes added.

Object-oriented programming means putting real-life objects into programming. 
It allows us break down complex objects into smaller pieces in softwares. 


const mouse = {
  brand: 'Logi',
  price: 29.99,
  reviews: 4.4,
  colors: [ 'Black', 'Blue', 'White', 'Pink' ]
};


const car = {
  make: 'Mercedes',
  model: 'GLC300',
  year: 2024,
  price: 50000,
  color: ['Black', 'White']
};


Chase - Banking apps 
const customer = {
  fname,
  lname,
  accountNumber,

};


CONSTRUCTOR: used to create / instantiate an object using new keyword from its template/blueprint/prototype.

const date = new Date();
const arr = new Array();
const obj = new Object();
