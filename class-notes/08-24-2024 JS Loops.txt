Loops: they are used to run a block of code many times. 

for(let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
  // block of code
  console.log(i)
}


1. FOR LOOP:
initialization 
condition 
update - change


INFINITE LOOP: a loops never terminates
for(let i = 10; i > 1; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

for( ; ; ) {
  console.log('Hello');
}



2. WHILE LOOP 

while(condition) {
  // block of code to execute
}



1     6
4     2
9     8


let written = 1; 
let guess = undefined; 


while(guess !== written) {
  guess = getRandomNumber(1, 10); // 4, 7, 1
}

console.log('Numbers finally matched!');



let written = 1; 
let guess = undefined; 

for( ; ; ) {
  guess = getRandomNumber(1, 10);
  attempts++;
  if(guess === written) break;
}

for loop - i 



// Solving some questions like count, sum, product, etc.

1. First, declare your variables on the top to store final results and assign them some default values
count = 0, sum = 0, product = 1, factorial = 1, arr = [], obj = {}, num = undefined, bool1 = false

2. Create your loop to compose your results
3. Return or log your final results once the loop is completed



for loop    -> 50-60 percent of the time (fixed iteration)
for...of loop -> 30-40 percent of the time (arrays)
while loop -> 5-10 percent of the time (condition)
do...while and for...in loop -> 1-2 percent of the time


for loop        vs          while loop 
Do I know how many times this loop exactly run?

      YES                     NO
    for loop              while loop


3. DO WHILE LOOP 


let i = 5; 

while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

OUTPUT:
5
6
7
8
9

i = 5;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
while(i < 10);

OUTPUT:
5
6
7
8
9
